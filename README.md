# nanogpt-jax
Implementation of [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) in Jax/Flax that's currently WIP

This repo will contain two things:
1. A performant implementation of NanoGPT in Jax that mostly sticks to Kaparthy's layout. (```./nanogpt```)
3. A simple GPT implementation in a single file of ~200 lines in Jax that you can run in Colab. (```./simple/simple.py```)

## Install
Create venv
```
python3 -m venv myenv
```
Activate venv
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies
```
pip install jax tiktoken optax
```

## Run
For nanogpt:
```

```

For the single file GPT:
```
Copy and paste to Colab, connect to TPU, and you're good to go.
```
