# Simple GPT

The simple GPT implementation in a single file of ~270 lines using Jax.

```simple.py``` is the file that contains the model, training loop, and inference.

```simple.ipynb``` is a notebook that demonstrates how to use the model for training and text generation. This is what is opened by the colab button in the main README.
